*Confession submission here* 

This document explains the meaning of content warnings (CW), trigger warnings (TW), what triggers are and the types of triggers that have been identified.  

## Types of Warnings 

1. Content warnings (CW) can be verbal or written notices that precede potentially sensitive content.
2. Trigger warnings (TW)  are a specific variety of content warning that attempt to forewarn content that may cause intense physiological and psychological symptoms for people. The aim is to let people with mental health concerns avoid or prepare themselves for triggers. There is absolutely no intention of trying to censor any information. Some have found trigger warnings to be helpful as they allow people with posttraumatic stress to feel safe. It is impossible to predict or avoid all triggers, since many are unique to a person’s situation.

### What are Triggers? 

A trigger is a predictable or unpredictable personal reminder of a past trauma, activated through one or more of the five senses: sight, sound, touch, smell and taste.

This reminder can cause a person to feel overwhelming sadness, anxiety, or panic. It may also cause someone to have [flashbacks](https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/psychpedia/flashbacks). A flashback is a vivid, often negative memory that may appear without warning. It can cause someone to lose track of their surroundings and “relive” a traumatic event.

A trigger can also be a cue that prompts an increase in symptoms. For example, a person recovering from [anorexia](https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/psychpedia/anorexia-nervosa) may be triggered by photos of very thin celebrities. When the person sees these photos, they may feel the urge to starve themselves again.
