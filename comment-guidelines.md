# SAMH Comment Guidelines
### THINK before you comment. Everything in this group is highly sensitive information, so it is imperative to comment responsibly.
### Be a good support
* You can refer to this powerpoint for further info on being a good support:   https://samh.link/goodsupport 
* Some tips: 
	* Keep the focus on the other person/their situation
	* Ask questions if unsure, preferably using “what” and “how” as opposed to “why”
		* Ex. “Why you do ...?” **instead** “How did you decided...?”
		* Ex. “You’re not gonna .... are you?” **instead** “How do you feel about ...?”
		* Ex. “You should ...” **instead** “What are your thoughts about...?”
* Avoid making “armchair” diagnoses - while we can speculate, a diagnosis has weight and is something that should be done by someone with the proper training and ability to provide resources
* If you use personal experiences or experiences of others, please add trigger/content warnings and follow the format.
