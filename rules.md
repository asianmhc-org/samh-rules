## Rules for all of SAMH ( Chats/ Discord/ Discussion)
### 1. Be kind and courteous and respectful
* We’re all in this together to create a welcoming environment. Let’s treat everyone with respect. Healthy debates are natural, but kindness is required. This is a SAFE SPACE. Please tag any of the admins or mods if there is any problem whatsoever and we will try to mediate the situation.
* Do not invalidate a person's struggles or mental illness. Some examples of invalidation are: "Hey I had it worse than you" or "There are people dying in Africa" or "What do you have to be sad about?" or "Change your mindset" or "Go do *generic activity*" or "It'll get better with time".
* Be sensitive to other’s experiences. Please refer to this document for guidelines: https://samh.link/rules/goodsupport
* We want to be inclusive to everyone, however, **THIS IS PRIMARILY AN ASIAN SPACE**, so please do not impose on others because these mental health issues are extremely serious and can be severe in our communities. If you are not Asian and members find that you are clearly causing trouble and imposing, you will receive a level 2 warning or immediate ban, depending on the situation.
### 2. No hate speech or bullying
Make sure everyone feels safe. Bullying of any kind isn’t allowed, and degrading comments about things like race, religion, culture, sexual orientation, gender, or identity will not be tolerated. Again, tag the admins or mods and we will take action.
### 3. Surveys & Studies
* Academic Research with IRB approval will be considered
* Academic Research without IRB approval will be considered with proper documentation
* Data collection for personal or business use will be on a case by case basis
See [https://samh.link/rules/posts](/rules/post-guidelines)
### 4. No promotions or spam
* Give more than you take from this group. Self-promotion, spam, and irrelevant links are not allowed. 
* No Crowdfunding, Fundraisers or monetary-related promotions - this includes fundraisers for nonprofit organizations as an individual or a team.
* No affiliate links, branded links or content intended to drive or benefit from traffic - this includes promoting content from your page/ business/ practice
* User-Created content is allowed within reason (no excessive promo)
### 5. Respect everyone’s privacy
* Being part of this group requires mutual trust. Authentic, expressive discussions make groups great, but may also be sensitive and private. What’s shared in the group should stay in the group.
* Do not expose or out members of the group. This can include a person's sexuality/ gender identity, mental health struggles or any issues in their personal lives. Knowing them outside of the group does not give you the right to out/ expose them.
* **IMPORTANT:** Many members of the group, including the admin/mod team typically give consent to privately message one another, however, this does not mean you can have the intention of hooking up with people or coming on to people. You are here for help, advice, someone to talk to. If you are found to be harassing anyone with this behavior, it is an immediate ban. 
### 6. Avoid giving people direct advice
Please refer to this document for tips on how to be a good support:

#### 7. You are responsible for the content that you post
This includes ensuring that you have the rights needed for you to post that content and that your content does not violate the legal rights of another party (for example, defamation) or any applicable laws.
#### 8. There is a 3-strike warning system for users
* We take moderating very seriously and keep a record of members who do not follow the rules. Like any 3-strike warning system– 3 strikes and you will receive an immediate ban.
* Each strike will be documented, screenshotted, and put into our database for evidence.
* Hate comments, extremely negative comments, and troll comments will result in  an instant ban.  
## Disclaimers:
Even though we are a mental health support group, **this is not a replacement for mental health services.** If you are having difficulties searching for a medical/professional advice/therapy, the admin/mod team will try our very best to guide you in the right direction. You are not alone, we are here to help.

**Anything said by the admin team is not a replacement for therapy.** Any advice or resources we provide does not constitute as medical advice or a medical diagnosis. We are simply providing insight and helping you take the steps to go in the right direction or seek professional help.

Our admin/mod/listening team consists of therapists/MD’s/people in training, **they have their own professional and personal lives.** Even though they have a lot of knowledge and experience that can be useful to our members, please know they are volunteering their time outside of their current jobs/internships.  If you are speaking to an admin/mod with clinical training/experience: **it is not a therapy session, replacement for therapy, and does not constitute as any type of professional or medical advice/diagnosis.** We are simply providing resources and insights to point you in the right direction or to begin seeking therapy.

Participating in a 1 on 1 listening session does not constitute as therapy. Our listening team is simply providing a safe space for you to open up. We will provide as much resources and advice that we can. **Nothing we say constitutes as medical advice or medical diagnosis.**

Speaking with anyone on the admin team **does not imply nor establish any type of therapist-client relationship.** In this capacity we will not diagnose or treat any mental health condition. This should not be considered a substitute for mental health evaluation/treatment.

Although admins/mods/members will provide advice and resources. **We are not equipped with the tools for suicide crisis.** If you are in an **immediate** crisis, please contact a suicide hotline in your region. Any posts regarding suicidal ideation will be flagged by admins. We will provide resources and as much emotional support we can give.

We are not liable for any articles or information you intake in this group. We will screen and check posts as much as possible. Use common sense.

**We do not endorse or verify content posted by users.** Our content and materials are provided to you “as is,” without any guarantees. You are solely responsible for your own use of the "subtle asian mental health" group. Posts from everyone here should not be treated as a substitute for professional advice for your specific situation. That said, the admin/mod does go through a heavy vetting process for wall posts that do not abide to the group rules and we will try our best to monitor ill-intentional/inappropriate comments in our group.
