# Post Guidelines
* Please be sure to read the group rules BEFORE wall posting.
* Each wall post will go through admin/mod verification before approving the post.
* Remember to add trigger/content warnings with the period formatting, so users do not see the post until they click “see more” if your post is triggering or has content that requires warnings.
* Make sure to state what type of support you need: support, validation, advice, tips.
* You can refer to this document for trigger/content warning usage: https://samh.link/twcw
* Please be aware that every post has the potential to be invalidated with inappropriate content/responses, tag the admins/mods on your post by commenting and we will get back to you ASAP.
* Posts will be automatically declined if they violate group rules or are irrelevant.
* Positive posts will not need formatting most of the time. Follow your gut and follow this guideline.
